# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project includes features such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. We explore different classification algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and others, to evaluate the best-performing model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Key Steps:

	1.	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the relationships between variables and inspecting data distributions.
	3.	Modeling: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease.
	4.	Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
	5.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Enhancing the modelâ€™s performance by tuning hyperparameters.

The goal of this project is to provide insights into factors influencing heart disease and build a reliable model for prediction, which could assist in early diagnosis and prevention.
